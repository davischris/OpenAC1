# OpenAC1

This work is largely based on the work of Tor-Eirik Bakke Lunde (https://github.com/tebl/RC6502-Apple-1-Replica).  I really liked his project and I had just read "Apple 1 Replica Creation: Back to the Garage" by Tom Owad, so I was very interested in making a "workalike" Apple 1.

I wanted to extend this project to include USB keyboard and VGA monitor support, as well as the ability to read programs from an SD card.

This project also includes code from other open source projects including Geoff Graham's VT100 Teminal Emulator (https://geoffg.net/terminal.html) including David Hansel's modification to use a USB keyboard.
